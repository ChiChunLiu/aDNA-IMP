Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	12	down_sample_bams
	1	ref_all
	13

rule down_sample_bams:
    input: ../data/bam/1240k/KM4_allmerged_rmdup_reheader_1240k.trimmed.bam
    output: ../data/bam/1240k/downsampled/KM4_allmerged_rmdup_reheader_1240k_0.5x.trimmed.bam
    jobid: 9
    wildcards: id=KM4, coverage=0.5

Shutting down, this might take some time.
