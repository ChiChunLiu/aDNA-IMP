![Imputation Reference Panel Bias versus Reference Genome Bias ](aTBN_imputation.analysis.jpg)

I visualize imputation bias with z-scores of f4(ancestral, X; pseudo-haloid ancient, imputed diploid ancient), where X is a present-day population in the reference panel. A significantly positive z-score indicates that the imputed ancient genotypes are biased toward the reference population X. In this example, I'm imputing ancient individuals from Nepal. There is clear biases with East Asian populations as references.
